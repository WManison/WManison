# About me:
My name is West and I'm a Junior for a Bachelors in Computer Science with a minor in Philosophy. I am very solution based and task oriented when it comes to the way that I think about code and algorithms. Finding a problem and coming up with a solution is a fun and powerful way to understand and reconcile with new and confusing topics. My current interests include: 
- Cybersecurity
- Web Development
- Algorithms
- Javascript 
- Java
- Foucault
- Chess 
- Plants

	- Programs with different data structures (Java [stacks, queues, priority queues, etc.])
